# APIprofect
I'm glad to introduce my first simple app without using a storyboard. 
In this case, i realised some features with UIKit, EasyPeasy (Pod for set constraints) and UserDefaults instead of a database. 
The app presents a few views, first of all, is loginVC with two textFields and two buttons (sing in and sign up) 
Second VC represents registration view with comparison each textField by nums and chars (if interested pls go up on the file String+Extention in the project) 
The third VC is using API for depicting albums from Itunes. At the top of view, you can use searchBar for searching any album
