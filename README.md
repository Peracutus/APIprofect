<h2>Simple test application without using a storyboard. </h2> 
In this case, i realised some features with UIKit, EasyPeasy (Pod for set constraints) and UserDefaults instead of a database.</p>
The app presents a few views, first of all, is loginVC with two textFields and two buttons (sing in and sign up) </p>
Second VC represents registration view with comparison each textField by nums and chars (if interested pls go up on the file String+Extention in the project) </p>
The third VC is using API for depicting albums from Itunes. At the top of view, you can use searchBar for searching any album </p>
